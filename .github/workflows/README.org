* About CUE

I am trying out [[https://cuelang.org/][CUE]]. At the moment there are no [[https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/schema/][schema definitions]]. It would be
possible to import the [[https://www.schemastore.org/json/][GitHub Workflow JSON schema]] to create one ([[https://youtu.be/Ey3ca0K2h2U?t=1244][video]]). If we
had a schema, we could validate the workflows. However, this is already covered
by [[https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint][actionlint]] which runs through the [[https://github.com/github/super-linter][Super-Linter]]. The command to import the
schema is something like =cue import -l '#Workflow:' -p github jsonschema:
<filename>=.

When we have created some schemas and sub-schemas we can use =cue trim= to
remove boilerplate from the workflows. This is because [[https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/constraints/][values defined in a
constraint do not have to be included in the data]].

All of the CUE files here have been created with =cue import=.

One small caveat is that Dependabot will not be able to create pull requests for
the CUE files.
