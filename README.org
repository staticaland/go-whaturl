#+title: whaturl

Hi!

* Usage

If you run the program, it will wait for input from STDIN.

#+begin_src sh
whaturl
#+end_src

You can write lines to it and get a result by pressing enter. To finish, press
Ctrl+D to send [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character][EOT]]. The more common approach is to pipe something directly:

#+begin_src sh
cat urls | whaturl
#+end_src
