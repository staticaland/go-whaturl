#+title: whaturl

=whaturl= replaces URLs found in text with a markup hyperlink with the contents
of the =<title>= tag in the HTML of the URL. It works like a typical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28software%29][Unix
filter]]:

#+begin_src sh
echo "I like https://github.com" | whaturl
I like [GitHub: Where the world builds software · GitHub](https://github.com)
#+end_src

* Usage

If you run the program, it will wait for input from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)][stdin]].

#+begin_src sh
whaturl
#+end_src

You can write lines to it and get a result by pressing enter. To finish, press
Ctrl+D to communicate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character][end-of-transmission]]. However, the more common use-case is
to pipe something directly:

#+begin_src sh
cat urls | whaturl
#+end_src

* Editor integration

** Vim

#+begin_example
nnoremap <leader>l :%!whaturl<CR>
vnoremap <leader>l :!whaturl<CR>
#+end_example

This is reminiscent of the [[https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-koans/][Vim Kōan /Master Wq and the Markdown acolyte/]].

** Emacs

I use =reformatter.el= (see [[https://github.com/staticaland/doom-emacs-config/blob/master/modules/editor/reformatter/config.el][my reformatter.el configuration here]]).
